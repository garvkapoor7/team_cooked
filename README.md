##AWS Serverless Chatbot for Customer Service

I have created a chatbot fro customer service using LLMs and Langchain.
I have wriiten the whole code in AWS Sagemaker.

Here are the steps for createing buckets to creating notebook instances for this model:

1. First create an IAM user and give access permissions for accessing Sagemaker, S3 Bucket.
   
3. Then, create a S3 bucket to upload the dataset which will be loaded by Sagemaker later.
4. Now open Sagemaker and create a notebook instance.
